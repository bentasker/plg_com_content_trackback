# plg com_content trackback


This is the plugin I sometimes refer to a [Sitemap Update Ping](https://www.bentasker.co.uk/shoparchives/joomla-extensions/333-sitemap-update-ping)

It was originally written for Joomla 2.5/3.x and there hasn't been any further development on it in quite some time. It's no longer supported in any way.

It may, or may not work on Joomla 4.


Original description was:

    Plugin to send trackbacks for com_content articles. This functionality already exists for K2 and other CCMS' but hasn't existed for com_content since J1.5.
